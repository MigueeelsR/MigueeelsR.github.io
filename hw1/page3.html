                    Programming is a huge part of today's technological advancements but the future of programming will go a significant transformation. Mostly driven by the massive advancements in quantum computing and artifical intelligence (AI). Quantum computing will allow compuiters to use quantum mechanics to process information in a completely different more advanced way. Qubts is the basic unit of Quantum information that can represent both 1s and 0s at the same time, qubits are entangled so the state of a single qubit is related to the state of another regardless of distance between them. In the future there will be new programming languages designed for quantum logic or use a hybrid language and will help programmers develop algurithms that take full advantage of quantum computing.

                Arifitial Intelligence is already making an impact in the coding world with tools that assist programmers wirte and debug code. However, in the future AI systems will be able to fully autonomusly generate code by using high level descriptions provided by programmers and turn it into fully functional software. It will not replace programmers but will be used as a tool to make programmer's tasks easier, it will help routine tasks giving developers more time to focus on more creative aspects of developing software. Another way AI will help revolutionsize the future is bt maintiaining and udating software, rather than having to wait for bugs to appear AI systems can predict and fix issues before they become a problem. AI will be able to continuously monitor and refractor code making it more optimized and more efficient as AI technology continues to advance. This will significantly reduce time and effort needed to make sure software runs smoothly and more reliably.

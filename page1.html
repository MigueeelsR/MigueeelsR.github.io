                The first computer programming language dated back in 1883, developed by Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage who worked together on the Analytical Engine, they created an algorithm of numbers for the first computer program that was used to compute Bernoulli numbers. In 1949 assembly language was the first computeer programming language that simplified machine code language, which is required to tell the computer what to do. In the year 1983 C++ was created by Bjarne Stoustrup, which was built as an extension to C programming language and is still one of the most used programming languages in the world.

            Prgamming Languages are the backbone of computer science. With them we're able to communicate with machines and build applications, programs, and innovations of our world. This website provides an overview of the history of programming languages, different types of programming languages, and topic 3. Most porgramming languages that are used today were built on concepts of older languages and use them as the foundation. The newer languages are designed to further simplify work for computer programmers, with technology countinously expanding overtime programming languages will help lead to new innovations.

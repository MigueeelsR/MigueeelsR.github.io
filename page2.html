                There are various major types of modern programming languages, such as Procedural Programming Languages that focus on breaking down problems step by step some of these language examples are C, Cobol, BASIC, and Pascal. Another type of programming languages are Functional Programming Languages that focus on manipulating data structures without modifying old data to creae a more predicable outcome, some examples include Haskell and Scara. The widest used languages today are Object Oriented Programming Languages, these languages have programs organized oround objects to contain data and actions, and some examples include Python, Java, and C++. There are also Scipting and Dynamic Languages often used automated tasks ot to make web pages more interactie, a few examples are JavaScript and Ruby. Lastly, Logic Programming Languages focus on problem solving using reasoing and logic, thry provide unique ways of apporoaching problems used in artificial intelligence applications, one example is Prolog.
